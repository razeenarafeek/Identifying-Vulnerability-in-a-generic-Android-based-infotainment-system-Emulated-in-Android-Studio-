Aim
The primary aim of this project is to assess the risks associated with Android-based car infotainment systems. By emulating these systems within Android Studio and utilizing advanced security tools such as ZAP (Zed Attack Proxy) and Nessus, the project seeks to identify, analyze, and mitigate potential security vulnerabilities that could compromise the safety, privacy, and functionality of these systems.

Description
As modern vehicles become increasingly connected, the integration of sophisticated infotainment systems running on Android OS has become common. These systems offer a wide range of features, including internet connectivity, navigation, and multimedia capabilities, enhancing the overall driving experience. However, the complexity and connectivity of these systems also introduce significant security risks. Malicious actors could exploit vulnerabilities in these systems to gain unauthorized access, steal sensitive data, or disrupt critical vehicle functions.
This project aims to thoroughly assess the security posture of Android-based car infotainment systems through a multi-faceted approach

Emulation of Infotainment Systems
Utilizing Android Studio, the project will set up an emulated environment that closely replicates the Android-based car infotainment system. This emulation allows for detailed testing and analysis without the need for physical hardware, making the process efficient and accessible.
